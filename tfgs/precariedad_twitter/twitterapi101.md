# Twitter API

Twitter offers developers a series of RESTful APIs that allow interaction with 
the platform. Through APIs, you can create content like this as well as extract 
data.

The first thing to use any API is to carefully read its [documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api),
which allows knowing the functionalities available to the developer. Then it is 
recommended to have an API RESTful client, for example [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/), 
to make test requests and view responses. Once you have the selected the programming 
language with which you are going to work, you can choose a client written in the 
selected language to facilitate the operation of the API. [Here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) 
Twitter documents an extensive list of open-source libraries that enable the 
interaction with their API.

Although the APIs are publicly accessible, they force users to obtain a credential 
to use them. On Twitter, you must create a developer account and then submit an 
API access request. There are two types of requests. The standard request, which 
is intended for general-purpose usages. Also, Twitter offers the possibility of 
applying to access the API for academic research. In both cases, you have to fill 
out a request form explaining, among other things, the expected use of the API, 
such as how it is planned to use the data and how the results will be published 
or made available.

In this [link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api), 
it is described the steps to get started with the API of Twitter.
